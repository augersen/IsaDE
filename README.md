This is a bit of a personal project based on my course Computer Systems at DTU.
The goal of the project is to be able to create ISAs and simulate code in that specific ISA.

Features I hope to have:
- ISA definitions
- Code with own syntax
- Runnable programs
- Debugger that allows you to run one cycle at a time while showing all reserves and PC
- Different bit sizes ranging from 1 - 64 (no clue why you would do 1)
- Customizable opcodes
- Possibility to convert to real asm
- Editor GUI with support for 
    - File storing and opening
    - Running programs
    - Compilation into C
    - Custom amount of operations & reserves
- Project creation with schematics for reserve naming, opcodes, etc.

Features I have added:
